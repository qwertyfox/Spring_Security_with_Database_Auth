# Spring_Security_with_Database_Auth
### ==== Part of personal research and practice =====
1. Spring Security with Bcrypt Encryption. Uses Sqlite3 as Database.
2. Database password field Bcrypt Hash (user passwords) created from BrowserLing.com with 10 strength/rounds.
3. Project lacks implementation of Roles and Authorities unlike previous Security project "springsecurity" but implements proper password protection measures.
4. To review, the passwords and usernames are saved in "User Password.txt" file
5. The URL to login is localhost:8080/login. Access to localhost:8080/welcome is protected.
