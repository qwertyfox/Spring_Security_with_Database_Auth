# Spring_Security_with_Database_Auth
==== Part of personal research and practice =====
Spring Security with Bcrypt Encryption. Uses Sqlite3 as Database.
Database password field Bcrypt Hash (user passwords) created from BrowserLing.com with 10 strength/rounds.
Project lacks implementation of Roles and Authorities unlike previous Security project "springsecurity" but implements proper password protection measures.
